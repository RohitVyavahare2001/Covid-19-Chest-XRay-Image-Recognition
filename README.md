COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-rays
Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project aimed at improving COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays. The goal is to assist medical professionals and researchers in quickly and accurately identifying COVID-19 cases, leading to more efficient diagnosis and treatment.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was released by the University of Montreal and comprises chest X-ray images categorized into three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. The images are organized into a simple directory structure with separate folders for training and testing data.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Model Architecture
The deep learning model architecture used for COVID-19 detection consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to produce the probability distribution over the three classes.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability to effectively distinguish between Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Please refer to the project report for detailed results and analysis.

Acknowledgements
We would like to express our gratitude to the University of Montreal for providing the COVID-19 X-ray dataset, which made this research possible.

Future Work
We encourage the community to contribute to this project and explore potential improvements, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and experimenting with different model architectures to achieve higher accuracy.
